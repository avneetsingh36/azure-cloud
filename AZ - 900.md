### What is cloud computing?
___
CC is the delivery of computing services over the internet:
- Virtual Machines
- Storage
- DB
- Networking
- IoT, ML and AI too

We can get rid of the need to have physical datacenters per company and now this is something that a company could outsource to Microsoft.

### Shared Responsibility Model
___
Responsibilities that are traditionally needed to be managed are now distributed across the consumer and cloud provider. With on-premise, you are responsible for everything but when you decide to go with a cloud provider, you the roles and duties shift.

Responsibilities for the Cloud Provider
- physical security
- power
- cooling
- network connectivity

Responsibilities for the Consumer
- consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud
- access control
- syncing data between VM and Cloud

### Cloud Models
___
Three main cloud models are: **Private, Public, Hybrid**

Private Cloud is a cloud used only by a single entity.

Public Cloud is a cloud that is maintained by a third-party cloud provider - anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources - key difference is that there is public availability.

Hybrid Cloud -> uses both private clouds and public in an interconnected environment.

Multi-cloud uses many public service providers all at once.

Azure Arc is a set of technologies that can help manage your cloud environment and Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads with Azure in a seamless integration and scalability.

### Consumption Based Model
___
There are 2 types of expenses to consider - **CapEx and OpEx**

Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
- one time to purchase and secure tangible resources.

Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
- recurring overhead

Most of cloud computing is an operational expense since the Cloud provider will take care of the physical infrastructure - good because you only pay for what you USE. Pay as you go pricing model is very popular.

Cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone elseâ€™s datacenter.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing
___

High availability - focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur. Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a rate at which there is downtime (99% uptime means that it will be up 99% of the time).  

Scalability - adjusting resources to meet demand is a huge benefit of cloud computing
- vertical scaling - is focused on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources
- horizontal is adding or subtracting the number or resources

Reliability and Predictability
- due to its decentralized design, the cloud is naturally a reliable and resilient infrastructure and enables you to have resources deploying in regions all around the world
- there is a lot of performance and cost predictability

Performance and Cost
- the cloud takes care of auto-scaling, load balancing and high availability for you so there is no extra worry needed there as it can be black boxed out
- predicting future cost is easy
	- there are many data analytic tools that help make this smooth
	- many tools to predict cost

### Security and Governance
___
There is cloud based auditing to help flag any resource that is out of compliance with corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies.

It is easy to find the cloud solution that matches your security needs. 

### Manageability in the Cloud
___
In the cloud you can:
- automatically scale resource deployment based on need
- deploy preconfigured templates
- monitor health of resources and automatically replace failing resources
- receive automatic alerts based on the configured metrics

You can manage your cloud:
- through web portal
- CLI
- APIs
- PowerShell

### Cloud Service Types
___

Infrastructure as a service - most flexible category of cloud services, as it provides the most amount of possible control for your cloud resources. The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware and you are responsible for everything else: OS installation, Configurations, maintenance, networking, DB and Storage Configuration. IaaS is commonly used in lift-and-shift migration (from datacenters to cloud) centers and testing and development.

Platform as a service is a middle ground. In PaaS, you don't need to worry about licensing or patching for an OS and DBs; it is well suited for complete development environment without a headache of maintaining all the development infrastructure. PaaS is used a lot for development and analytics or business intelligence.


Software as a service is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. With SaaS, you are essentially renting or using a fully developed application. Email, financial software, messaging apps, and connectivity software is all found in the SaaS implementation. Common use case is email and messaging, business productivity apps and finance and expense tracking.

### What is offered by Azure?
___
Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that give you the freedom to manage build and deploy applications.

### Using a Sandbox
___
Most Azure commands will start with `az`. 

### Azure's Physical Infrastructure
___
Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region that is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking; each availability zone is connected via private fiber-optic networks.

When you host infrastructure, setting up your own redundancy requires you to create duplicate hardware environments, but Azure can help you make your app very available through zones.

You can have your data be synced (likely at an extra cost) to multiple availability zones to achieve redundancy.

Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL DBs.

There are Region Pairs and Sovereigns Regions as well:
- Region -> where 2 or more regions are interconnected
- Sovereign -> isolated for sensitive work like gov't work

### Azure Management Infrastructure
___
The management infrastructure includes Azure resources and resource groups, subscriptions, and accounts. 

A resource is a basic building block of Azure - anything that we create, provision, and deploy is a resource - examples include VMs, Virtual Networks, DBs, cognitive services are all resources.

Resource groups are just a group of resources and when you create a resource you are required to place it into a RG. 

When you **apply an action** to a resource group, it will apply the change to all the resources inside that group. 

If you **delete** the RG, then all the resources inside will be deleted.

Same thing with granting **access** - you can selectively grant access and remove access to certain groups.

### Azure VMs
___
![[Pasted image 20240720220204.png]]

First - what are VMs --> Virtual computers within computers that:
- hav CPUs, Memory Disks, Wifi
- use resources from your local host or a cloud provider
- VM is a computer file that is typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer
- can run a window as a separate computing environment, often to run a different OS
- is partitioned from the rest of the system - the software inside a VM cannot interfere with he host computer's OS

VMs are used to:
- build and deploy apps to the cloud
- trying out a new OS
- spinning up a new environment to make it simpler and quicker for devs to run dev-testing scenarios
- backing up your existing OS
- accessing virus infected data or running an old app by installing an older OS
- running software or apps on a OS that works 

A **hypervisor** (aka VM Manager) lets you run different OS on the same VM at the same time. VMs are extremely portable - you can log in to one on a new OS at an instant. 

Due to their flexibility and portability they provide benefits such as:
- cost savings
- agility and speed
- lowered downtime
- scalability
- security benefits

With Azure, you can create and use VMs in the cloud. VMs provide infrastructure as a service (Iaas) in the form of a virtualized server and it can be used in many ways. Just like a physical computer, you can customize all of the software running on your VM and you should use VMs if you want to:
- Have total control over the OS
- Have the ability to run custom software
- To use custom hosting configs

You need to make sure that you configure, update, and maintain the software that runs on a VM

You can create or even use an already created image to rapidly provision VMs - an image is a template used to create a VM and may already include OS and other software - like dev tools/apps/libraries.

#### Scaling VMs in Azure

You can run multiple VMs in azure at the same time if you want to - you can use Azure VM scale sets which allow you to create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs. 

You can manipulate the update domain (reboot the VM updates all at the same time) and fault domain (split compute across multiple domains) at no extra cost through Azure.

When you should be using VMs:
- during testing and development
	- VMs provide a quick and easy way to test out different OS and application configs
	- test and dev  personnel can easily delete VMs when no longer needed
- when running apps in the cloud
	- can run certain apps in the cloud as opposed to created a traditional infrastructure can provide a lot of economic benefit 
	- a lot of apps, websites, and require varying amounts of compute power when spinning up, so you relying on your local machine to handle this is foolish haha
	- when demand goes up, you can scale up and down accordingly
	- deleting VMs when you do not need them or spinning up new ones when you want to distribute resources helps too
- when extending your datacenter on the cloud: and org can extend capabilities of its own on-premise network by creating virtual network in AZ and adding VMs to that network

Move to the cloud with VMs - you can literally put the physical image of your hw on to the cloud

### Aside - [[What is Nginx]]
- basically a gateway that stands in between the internet and backend server that helps with load balancing, caching, and can be a reverse proxy (server that sits in front of web servers and forwards client requests to the correct servers).

### Describe Azure Virtual Desktop
___
Another type of VM is Azure Virtual Desktop - AVD is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud. It enables you to use a cloud-hosted version Windows from any location

AVD vs Azure VMs:
- Purpose - Azure VMs provide infrastructure for hosting virtual machines, while AVD provides a virtual desktop experience for end users
- OS - Azure VMs can run both Windows and Linux OS while AVD only provides a Windows 10 virtual desktop environment
- Access - Azure VMs can be accessed and managed through a remote desktop connection, while AVD provides access to a virtual desktop through a remote display protocol
- User Experience - Azure VMs offers a traditional desktop experience, while VD provides a highly optimized, remote desktop experience for users
- Management - Azure VMs require manual management and configuration, while AVD is fully a managed by Microsoft
- Scalability - Both Azure VMs and AVD provide scalability, but Azure VMs require manual configuration and scaling, while AVD provides automatic scaling.
- Security - AVD has more additional security features such as multi-factor authentication
- Cost - The cost of Azure VMs and AVD varies based on the size and configuration of the virtual machines, and AVD generally has a higher cost to do its fully managed thing
- Customization - Azure VMs offer more customization options, while AVD proves a standardized VD experience
- Resource alloc - Azure VMs allow you to allocate resources such as CPU, memory and storage while AVD provides a pre-configured virtual desktop environment
- Data Management - Both Azure VMs and AVD provide options for data management, but Azure VMs require manual data management (has it's tradeoffs), while AVD provides integrated management options
- Application Compatibility - Both Azure VMs and AVD support a wide rage of applications, but AVD is optimized for windows 10 and windows apps
- Remote Access - Both Azure VMs and AVD, but AVD offers a remote desktop experience that is optimized for end-users 
- Network Connectivity - Both azure and AVD offer network connectivity options but AVD provides a fully managed network connectivity solution
- Collaboration - Both Azure VMs and AVD allow collaboration, but AVD has more streamlined collaboration experience through integrated collaboration tools
- Deployment - Azure VMs require manual deployment and configuration, while AVD provides a fully managed deployment process
- Backup and Recovery - Both Azure VMs and AVD provide a backup and recovery options, but AVD provides a fully managed recovery solution
- Monitoring and Maintenance - Both Azure VMs and AVD provide options, but AVD better
- Integration - same 

Azure VMs offer customizable infrastructure for hosting virtual machines with both Windows and Linux OS, requiring manual management and scaling, while Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) provides a fully managed, optimized Windows 10 virtual desktop experience with automatic scaling, centralized security management via Microsoft Entra ID, multifactor authentication, role-based access controls, separation of data and apps from local hardware, and isolated user sessions, generally at a higher cost.
### Azure Containers
___
While VMs are a great way to reduce costs for physical HW, they're still limited to a single OS per VM. If you want to run multiple instances of an application on a single host machine, containers are excellent.

What are containers? 

Containers are a virtualization environment. Much like running multiple virtual machines on a single physical host, you can run multiple containers on a single physical or virtual host. Unlike VMs, you don't need to manage the OS for a container. VMs appear to be an instance of an OS that you can connect to and manager vs containers are lightweight and designed to be created, scaled out, and stopped dynamically. It's possible to create and deploy VMs as an application demand increases, but containers are a lightweight, more agile way of doing so. Docker is popular.

Tangible Example: 
You might split a website into a container hosting your front end, another hosting your back end, and a third for storage. This split allows you to separate portions of your app into logical sections that can be maintained, scaled, or updated independently. This doesn't necessarily improve compute, but could help with readability and separation of resources.

Imagine your website back-end has reached capacity but the front end and storage aren't being stressed. With containers, you could scale the back end separately to improve performance. If something necessitated such a change, you could also choose to change the storage service or modify the front end without impacting any of the other components.

### Azure Functions
___
Azure Functions are an event-driven, server-less compute option that does not require maintaining VMs or containers. If you build an app using VMs or containers, those resources have to be "running" in order for your app to function. With Azure Functions, an event wakes up the function, alleviating the need to keep resources provisioned when there are no events.

Benefits:
- using Azure Functions is ideal when you are only concerned with code running your service and not about the underlying platform or infrastructure
- functions are commonly used when you need to perform work in response to an event (often via REST request), timer or message from another assure service. When that work can be completed quickly, within seconds.
- functions scale automatically based on demand, so they may be a good choice when demand is variable
- Azure functions runs code when its triggered and automatically deallocates resources when the function is finished - in this model, you are only charged for the CPU time and used while your function runs
- Functions can either be stateless or stateful 
	- they are stateless (default) when they behave as if they're restarted every time they respond to an event
	- they are stateful if (called durable functions) if a context is passed through the function to track prior activity
- are a key component of serverless computing
- they're also general compute platform for running any type of code
- if they needs of a dev app change, you can deploy the project in an environment that isn't server-less - this allows for scaling, run on virtual networks, or even completely isolate functions
