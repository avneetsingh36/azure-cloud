### What is cloud computing?
___
CC is the delivery of computing services over the internet:
- Virtual Machines
- Storage
- DB
- Networking
- IoT, ML and AI too

We can get rid of the need to have physical datacenters per company and now this is something that a company could outsource to Microsoft.

### Shared Responsibility Model
___
Responsibilities that are traditionally needed to be managed are now distributed across the consumer and cloud provider. With on-premise, you are responsible for everything but when you decide to go with a cloud provider, you the roles and duties shift.

Responsibilities for the Cloud Provider
- physical security
- power
- cooling
- network connectivity

Responsibilities for the Consumer
- consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud
- access control
- syncing data between VM and Cloud

### Cloud Models
___
Three main cloud models are: **Private, Public, Hybrid**

Private Cloud is a cloud used only by a single entity.

Public Cloud is a cloud that is maintained by a third-party cloud provider - anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources - key difference is that there is public availability.

Hybrid Cloud -> uses both private clouds and public in an interconnected environment.

Multi-cloud uses many public service providers all at once.

Azure Arc is a set of technologies that can help manage your cloud environment and Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads with Azure in a seamless integration and scalability.

### Consumption Based Model
___
There are 2 types of expenses to consider - **CapEx and OpEx**

Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
- one time to purchase and secure tangible resources.

Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
- recurring overhead

Most of cloud computing is an operational expense since the Cloud provider will take care of the physical infrastructure - good because you only pay for what you USE. Pay as you go pricing model is very popular.

Cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone elseâ€™s datacenter.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing
___

High availability - focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur. Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a rate at which there is downtime (99% uptime means that it will be up 99% of the time).  

Scalability - adjusting resources to meet demand is a huge benefit of cloud computing
- vertical scaling - is focused on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources
- horizontal is adding or subtracting the number or resources

Reliability and Predictability
- due to its decentralized design, the cloud is naturally a reliable and resilient infrastructure and enables you to have resources deploying in regions all around the world
- there is a lot of performance and cost predictability

Performance and Cost
- the cloud takes care of auto-scaling, load balancing and high availability for you so there is no extra worry needed there as it can be black boxed out
- predicting future cost is easy
	- there are many data analytic tools that help make this smooth
	- many tools to predict cost

### Security and Governance
___
There is cloud based auditing to help flag any resource that is out of compliance with corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies.

It is easy to find the cloud solution that matches your security needs. 

### Manageability in the Cloud
___
In the cloud you can:
- automatically scale resource deployment based on need
- deploy preconfigured templates
- monitor health of resources and automatically replace failing resources
- receive automatic alerts based on the configured metrics

You can manage your cloud:
- through web portal
- CLI
- APIs
- PowerShell

### Cloud Service Types
___

Infrastructure as a service - most flexible category of cloud services, as it provides the most amount of possible control for your cloud resources. The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware and you are responsible for everything else: OS installation, Configurations, maintenance, networking, DB and Storage Configuration. IaaS is commonly used in lift-and-shift migration (from datacenters to cloud) centers and testing and development.

Platform as a service is a middle ground. In PaaS, you don't need to worry about licensing or patching for an OS and DBs; it is well suited for complete development environment without a headache of maintaining all the development infrastructure. PaaS is used a lot for development and analytics or business intelligence.


Software as a service is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. With SaaS, you are essentially renting or using a fully developed application. Email, financial software, messaging apps, and connectivity software is all found in the SaaS implementation. Common use case is email and messaging, business productivity apps and finance and expense tracking.

### What is offered by Azure?
___
Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that give you the freedom to manage build and deploy applications.

### Using a Sandbox
___
Most Azure commands will start with `az`. 

### Azure's Physical Infrastructure
___
Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region that is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking; each availability zone is connected via private fiber-optic networks.

When you host infrastructure, setting up your own redundancy requires you to create duplicate hardware environments, but Azure can help you make your app very available through zones.

You can have your data be synced (likely at an extra cost) to multiple availability zones to achieve redundancy.

Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL DBs.

There are Region Pairs and Sovereigns Regions as well:
- Region -> where 2 or more regions are interconnected
- Sovereign -> isolated for sensitive work like gov't work

### Azure Management Infrastructure
___
The management infrastructure includes Azure resources and resource groups, subscriptions, and accounts. 

A resource is a basic building block of Azure - anything that we create, provision, and deploy is a resource - examples include VMs, Virtual Networks, DBs, cognitive services are all resources.

Resource groups are just a group of resources and when you create a resource you are required to place it into a RG. 

When you **apply an action** to a resource group, it will apply the change to all the resources inside that group. 

If you **delete** the RG, then all the resources inside will be deleted.

Same thing with granting **access** - you can selectively grant access and remove access to certain groups.

### Azure VMs
___
![[Pasted image 20240720220204.png]]

First - what are VMs --> Virtual computers within computers that:
- hav CPUs, Memory Disks, Wifi
- use resources from your local host or a cloud provider
- VM is a computer file that is typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer
- can run a window as a separate computing environment, often to run a different OS
- is partitioned from the rest of the system - the software inside a VM cannot interfere with he host computer's OS

VMs are used to:
- build and deploy apps to the cloud
- trying out a new OS
- spinning up a new environment to make it simpler and quicker for devs to run dev-testing scenarios
- backing up your existing OS
- accessing virus infected data or running an old app by installing an older OS
- running software or apps on a OS that works 

A **hypervisor** (aka VM Manager) lets you run different OS on the same VM at the same time. VMs are extremely portable - you can log in to one on a new OS at an instant. 

Due to their flexibility and portability they provide benefits such as:
- cost savings
- agility and speed
- lowered downtime
- scalability
- security benefits

With Azure, you can create and use VMs in the cloud. VMs provide infrastructure as a service (Iaas) in the form of a virtualized server and it can be used in many ways. Just like a physical computer, you can customize all of the software running on your VM and you should use VMs if you want to:
- Have total control over the OS
- Have the ability to run custom software
- To use custom hosting configs

You need to make sure that you configure, update, and maintain the software that runs on a VM

You can create or even use an already created image to rapidly provision VMs - an image is a template used to create a VM and may already include OS and other software - like dev tools/apps/libraries.

#### Scaling VMs in Azure

You can run multiple VMs in azure at the same time if you want to - you can use Azure VM scale sets which allow you to create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs. 

You can manipulate the update domain (reboot the VM updates all at the same time) and fault domain (split compute across multiple domains) at no extra cost through Azure.

When you should be using VMs:
- during testing and development
	- VMs provide a quick and easy way to test out different OS and application configs
	- test and dev  personnel can easily delete VMs when no longer needed
- when running apps in the cloud
	- can run certain apps in the cloud as opposed to created a traditional infrastructure can provide a lot of economic benefit 
	- a lot of apps, websites, and require varying amounts of compute power when spinning up, so you relying on your local machine to handle this is foolish haha
	- when demand goes up, you can scale up and down accordingly
	- deleting VMs when you do not need them or spinning up new ones when you want to distribute resources helps too
- when extending your datacenter on the cloud: and org can extend capabilities of its own on-premise network by creating virtual network in AZ and adding VMs to that network

Move to the cloud with VMs - you can literally put the physical image of your hw on to the cloud

### Aside - [[What is Nginx]]
- basically a gateway that stands in between the internet and backend server that helps with load balancing, caching, and can be a reverse proxy (server that sits in front of web servers and forwards client requests to the correct servers).
